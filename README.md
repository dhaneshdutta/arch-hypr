### ðŸª§ðŸª§ðŸª§ ANNOUNCEMENT ðŸª§ðŸª§ðŸª§

- Since the Hyprland-Dots are evolving, some of the screenshots maybe old

> [!IMPORTANT]
> install a backup tool like `snapper` or `timeshift`. and Backup your system before installing hyprland using this script. This script does NOT include uninstallation of packages

> [!NOTE]
> Main reason why I have not included an uninstallation script is simple. Some packages maybe already installed on your system by default. If I create an uninstall script with packages that I have set to install, you may end up a unrecoverable system. 

> [!WARNING] 
> Download this script on a directory where you have write permissions. ie. HOME. Or any directory within your home directory. Else script will fail

#### ðŸ†•  Prerequisites
- This install script is intended for atleast Server type / Minimal Arch Linux installed.

#### ðŸ”˜ Pipewire and Pipewire audio
- This script will install pipewire and will also disable or will uninstall pulseaudio. If you dont want it, you can simply just delete pipewire.sh in install-scripts folder before installing. 

#### âœ¨ Costumize the packages to be installed
- inside the install-scripts folder, you can edit 00-hypr-pkgs.sh. Care though as the Hyprland Dots may not work properly!
